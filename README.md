# Analysis And Forecast Of Perfume Demand
![FRAMEWORK](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a694c5fc-accf-432b-bf9e-dcbe28298515)
With the project “**Analysis & Forecasting Market Demand and Optimizing the Perfume Supply Chain**”, our goal is to use the business’s own data to
predict product demand, help optimize the import process, minimize unnecessary inventory
and at the same time increase efficiency in supply chain management.
This report not only provides specific analysis of market demand, but also
proposes solutions for applying data science to create long-term competitive advantages for businesses in the perfume business.
# (Phase 1): Extract - Transform - Load (ETL) (Project focus)
**The Analysis And Forecast Of Perfume Demand Project:** requires data on products, customers and purchase information. For the project we aggregate data from different sources from python's faker library, API and kaggle.

# (Phase 2): Overview and Forecasting 
**Visualization and Forecasting for Project:** Here we use a web framework Streamlit to help us present the results of the report and forecast. In Streamlit, users can interact with the chart at will and it can work online near realtime.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a5d3134-3623-4e95-a66c-70500e15040c)

- In **Da Nang** market, **Eau De Toilette** is higher than **Eau De Parfum**, but in **Hue** market, there is another advantage, **Eau De Parfum** is much higher than **Eau De Toilette**.
 ### Southern and South Central region (Ho Chi Minh, Ca Mau, Nha Trang):
- The lowest average temperature ranges from **26.16°C** to **26.99°C**, higher than both the North and Central regions, reflecting the typical hot and humid tropical monsoon climate.

- From the forecast temperature and historical temperature of **Ho Chi Minh City**, **Ca Mau** and **Nha Trang** in the period from 12/2023 to the end of 02/2024, the temperature is high, slightly higher than that of the North and Central regions and it always goes sideways with the temperature from **27°C** to **29°C** and is in this temperature range with **Eau De Cologne** and **Eau De Toilette** with concentration of **Eau De Cologne (2-4%)** and **Eau De Toilette (5-15%)**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51a86a5b-d0a2-49a2-99bf-866d11954630)

- In the Southern and South Central markets, people use two types of perfumes: **Eau De Cologne** and **Eau De Toilette**, but consumers prefer **Eau De Toilette**.
## Manufacturer:
- With big perfume manufacturers like **Dior** and **Chanel** will be the top priority because it has a large traffic compared to other perfume brands.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cd7ab80-7ce9-4ebf-98cc-24a44467294e)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/924d11cf-30b9-4b7f-99d3-ff8e9820aa01)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/094b6b65-81c0-431e-aa33-33f836066f01)

- With the search volume for products of two big brands like **Dior** and **Chanel** in the past being very high, it can be said that it is double that of other brands. With the forecast for the import and distribution plan for the next 90 days, the forecast for the search volume of Dior and Chanel perfumes tends to increase well, with Gucci and Bharara also being two famous brands in the market but the forecast for the next 90 days is that the search volume will gradually decrease.
## Business Plan Recommendations for next 90 days:
### Manufacturer:
- **Focus on two major perfume brands:** **Dior** and **Chanel**.
### Product Type:
 **Northern Region (Hanoi, Hai Phong):**
- Advertise and reach customers with **Eau De Parfum (15-20%)** concentration and **Perfume (20-30%)** concentration products.
- Prioritize importing and marketing **Eau De Parfum** as the main product.

 **Central region (Da Nang, Hue):**
- Advertise and reach customers with **Eau De Toilette (5-15%)** concentration and **Eau De Parfum (15-20%)** concentration products.
- Prioritize importing and marketing **Eau De Parfum** in **Hue** as the main product.

 **Southern and South Central region (Ho Chi Minh, Ca Mau, Nha Trang):**
- Advertise and reach customers with **Eau De Cologne (2-4%)** concentration and **Eau De Toilette (5-15%)** concentration products.
- Prioritize importing and marketing **Eau De Toilette** in **Ho Chi Minh** as the main product.
## Project Flow Chart

## Project Steps
### 1. Extract - Transform - Load (ETL) - ETL Pipeline
The pipeline helps update and store data contained in the `ETL_data.ipynb` file. The data in this system is run automatically by the APScheduler library, which synthesizes product data files, data from libraries and APIs, then transforms and extracts it and stores it in the local Database.

**- Data Extraction:**
+ Synthesize product data from the `data_sanpham.csv` file.
+ Combine MeteoStat and Faker libraries to create simulated customer data, orders, detailed orders and nominatim API to get data on the coordinates of cities.

**- Data Cleaning:**
+ Use the pandas library to clean the data in the `data_sanpham.csv` file such as removing duplicates, handling null values ​​and handling outliers

**- Feature Engineering and Transformation:**
+ Here I use 2 models, ARIMA and LSTM, extracting values ​​and using models in the code in the `Metric.py` file
+ Training the LSTM model to predict the weather in the file `Modeltrain_LSTM.ipynb`
#### 1.1 Usage
Here are the steps to setup and run the pipeline:
1. Need a code running environment like VS Code or Jupyter Notebook, ... and download the above files to the same place as the code running environment folder.
2. Open the `ETL_data.ipynb` file and need to install the necessary libraries first, open your SQL server and fill in your server information in the section that needs to be replaced in the `ETL_data.ipynb` file and run it, because it is scheduled to run every 5 minutes so you need to wait.
### 2. Data Analysis & Predictive Modelling
- We present actionable results overview charts for senior executives on the Dashboard side, and on the Analytics side we include more in-depth data on customers, products, and orders.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/751b7d9b-cfc4-4019-8b58-33e32f1d8bc0)
- With the forecasting model we are using to predict what the weather will be like in the next 90 days and what the search traffic for keywords related to the product will be in the coming months. This data combined with the company's historical data will help senior management make better decisions.
