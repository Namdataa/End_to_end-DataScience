![FRAMEWORK](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a694c5fc-accf-432b-bf9e-dcbe28298515)
With the project “Analysis & Forecasting Market Demand and Optimizing the Perfume Supply Chain”, our goal is to use the business’s own data to
predict product demand, help optimize the import process, minimize unnecessary inventory
and at the same time increase efficiency in supply chain management.
This report not only provides specific analysis of market demand, but also
proposes solutions for applying data science to create long-term competitive advantages for businesses in the perfume business.
# (Phase 1): Extract - Transform - Load (ETL) (Project focus)
**The Analysis And Forecast Of Perfume Demand Project:** requires data on products, customers and purchase information. For the project we aggregate data from different sources from python's faker library, API and kaggle.

# (Phase 2): Overview and Forecasting 
**Visualization and Forecasting for Project:** Here we use a web framework Streamlit to help us present the results of the report and forecast. In Streamlit, users can interact with the chart at will and it can work online near realtime.
