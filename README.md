With the project “Analysis & Forecasting Market Demand and Optimizing the Perfume Supply Chain”, our goal is to use the business’s own data to
predict product demand, help optimize the import process, minimize unnecessary inventory
and at the same time increase efficiency in supply chain management.
This report not only provides specific analysis of market demand, but also
proposes solutions for applying data science to create long-term competitive advantages for businesses in the perfume business.
